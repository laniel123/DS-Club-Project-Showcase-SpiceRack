    "A common problem I run into when shopping for groceries is completely forgetting what spices I already have at home. I’ll stand in the spice aisle, unsure whether I need anything, which often leads me to buy duplicates or skip the real spices I actually need. Other times, I end up with a single spice that doesn’t really pair with anything else I own, so it just sits in the pantry unused. Over time, this creates clutter, wasted money, and limits what I’m able to cook. While not a life-threatening issue, this project aims to introduce a quality-of-life feature that addresses it by helping users understand which spices they already have, how they relate to one another, and how they can be combined into consistent flavor profiles and practical recipes.\n"

    "Users will input the spices they currently have in their pantry. The system will analyze these spices to identify flavor profiles and common pairings. Based on these profiles, the application will recommend recipes that can be made with the user’s existing spices, as well as suggest complementary spices and recipes to expand their cooking options. The focus is on simplicity and usability, allowing users to quickly see how their spices can be used without needing extensive cooking knowledge."

    "As of right now, the project will be built using Python for data processing and modeling. Libraries such as pandas and NumPy will be used for data handling, while scikit-learn or similar tools may be used for clustering and similarity analysis of flavor profiles. Recipe and spice data will be sourced from Kaggle or publicly available datasets such as recipe APIs or open food databases. The final product may be presented through a simple web interface or notebook based demo. If there is enough time, I hope to present the project with a fully developed app. Implementing this step will be last, as none of us knows any app development. \n",
